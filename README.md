=========================

Olofsson: Audiovisual Programming - Remote control

In this course we will build and play with controllers and sensors that are displaced in space and time. How can we connect to and control sound, graphics and machines from a remote location? How do we get feedback on our actions? How to steer a robot when the control signal is severely delayed, interrupted or manipulated? With inspiration from spaceflight and network music and with the help of software like [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io) and hardware like [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc), we will investigate different phenomena like latency, inertia, fight for control, man in the middle attacks, data logging etc. Each week will have a slightly different topic and contain corresponding practical exercises. The aim of the course is to learn about programming and basic electronics in a fun and creative way.
