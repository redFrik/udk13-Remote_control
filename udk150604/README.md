please bring an arduino if you have one


windows

there is no serial port in supercollider windows. to get around that problem you can run [this](https://github.com/redFrik/udk13-Remote_control/tree/master/udk150604/windows/arduinoToSupercollider_via_processing/arduinoToSupercollider_via_processing.pde) small relay program in Processing. it is also possible to use puredata, python or maxmsp - basically any program that has a serial port and opensoundcontrol objects.
